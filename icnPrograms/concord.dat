             How to Order Icon Programming Language Material



    General Information: The prices listed on the order form include
    media, printed documentation (but not the books on Icon), han-
    dling and shipping in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
    Shipment to other countries is made by air mail only, for which
    there are additional charges as follows: $5 per diskette package,
    $10 per tape or cartridge package, and $10 per documentation
    package.  Commercial express delivery will be provided if author-
    ization and an account number to charge is given with the order.

    Payment: Payment may be made by check or money order, but credit
    card orders cannot be accepted.  Remittance _m_u_s_t be in U.S. dol-
    lars, payable to The University of Arizona.  There is a $10 ser-
    vice charge for a check drawn on a bank that does not have a
    branch in the United States.  Payment should accompany the order.
    For organizations that cannot provide pre-payment, purchase ord-
    ers will be accepted, but there is a $5 charge for processing
    such orders.

    The UNIX Package: The UNIX implementation of Icon can be config-
    ured to run on most computers with UNIX-based operating systems,
    including the VAX, Sun Workstation, IBM RT PC, AT&T 3B, and
    Pyramid.  The distribution contains source code, a test suite,
    the Icon program library, and documentation in machine-readable
    form.  Object and executable files are not included, since they
    depend on the target computer.

    The VMS Package: The VMS implementation requires VMS Release 4.2
    or higher. The distribution contains source code, a test suite,
    the Icon program library, and documentation in machine-readable
    form.  Object and executable files are included.

    _N_o_t_e: The UNIX and VMS packages contain different system-specific
    configurations and support material. Neither will run on the
    other system.

    The Macintosh Package: The Macintosh implementation runs as part
    of the MPW environment. It is not a stand-alone application; do
    not order this package unless you have MPW. The diskette includes
    executable files, a few sample programs, and documentation in
    machine-readable form.  Source code and the Icon program library
    are not yet available.  Information about MPW is available from:

    The MS-DOS Packages: The MS-DOS implementation of Icon runs on
    computers with 8086/88/186/286-family processors. IBM hardware
    compatibility is not necessary. MS- or PC-DOS Version 2.0 or
    higher is required.  There are both SMM and LMM implementations,
    and there are two forms of the LMM one. The SMM implementation
    uses 192k of memory. The LMM implementation requires at least
    256k, but runs better with more.  The SMM implementation is fas-
    ter and more compact than the LMM one, but it cannot handle pro-
    grams that need large amounts of storage.  There are two forms of
    the LMM implementation, one that allows Icon's storage regions to
    expand as needed (referred to as LMM/ER on the order form) and a
    `fixed-regions' one in which the regions cannot expand (referred
    to as LMM/FR on the order form). The LMM/FR implementation is
    considerably faster than the LMM/ER one, but it may not be able
    to use all of the available memory.  It is inadvisable to run
    more than over version of Icon on the same computer because of
    file-naming conflicts. The SMM, LMM/ER, and LMM/FR diskettes
    include executable files, a few sample programs, and documenta-
    tion in machine-readable form.

    The source code for MS-DOS has been compiled successfully under
    Microsoft C Version 4.0 and Lattice C Version 3.2.  It may be
    possible to use other C compilers, but this has not been done yet
    and certainly will require some work: _c_a_v_e_a_t _e_m_p_t_o_r. The distri-
    bution is in _a_r_c format and hence is suitable only for use on
    MS-DOS systems.  It includes source files, a configuration system
    for different C compilers, a set of tools, a test suite, and
    documentation in machine-readable form.

    The Icon program library for MS-DOS is the same for the SMM,
    LMM/ER, and LMM/FR implementations and is distributed on a
    separate diskette.

    The PC/IX Packages: The PC/IX implementation of Icon is a SMM
    one.  Source code and the Icon program library are distributed
    separately. The source code diskettes contain configuration
    information and test suites for other UNIX installations, such as
    the IBM RT PC. All PC/IX diskettes are written in _d_u_m_p/_r_e_s_t_o_r_e
    format, which is the same format as _b_a_c_k_u_p/_r_e_s_t_o_r_e on the RT PC
    under AIX.

    The XENIX Packages: The XENIX implementation of Icon was produced
    under SCO XENIX V with 8086 code.  It will run on other XENIX
    systems, although the full extent of compatibility is not known.
    There are both SMM and LMM/FR implementations.  It is inadvisable
    to run both the SMM and LMM/FR implementations on the same com-
    puter because of file-naming conflicts.  The Icon program library
    is distributed separately. Source code for XENIX is not yet
    available.  All XENIX diskettes are written in _t_a_r format.

    The Porting Package: This package is intended for porting Icon to
    operating systems and computers on which it has not already been

    IPD1d                         - 2 -             February 17, 1987






    implemented.  This version of Icon does not require a hierarchi-
    cal file system. In addition to the source code, there are port-
    ing instructions and suites of test programs. The distribution is
    in MS-DOS ASCII format for ease of file transfer. Individual
    files are packaged in larger files to reduce the effort of file
    transfer and a C program for unpacking them is included.  _N_o_t_e:
    Only 5-1/4'' diskettes are available. Persons requiring 3-1/2''
    diskettes will have to make arrangements for conversion.

    The Documentation Package: This package contains a copy of the
    Icon language book, a description of recent additions to the
    language, a compilation of material from the programming corners
    of previous Icon Newsletters, and other material related to pro-
    gramming in Icon.
